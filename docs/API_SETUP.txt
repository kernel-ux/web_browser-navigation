💡 PROMPT IMPROVEMENTS:

The new prompt:
✅ Works for ANY task (APIs, login, forms, navigation, etc)
✅ Doesn't force specific patterns
✅ Adapts based on what's on the page
✅ Detects when stuck and stops
✅ More natural AI reasoning

Examples that now work:
- "guide me to get gemini api" 
- "help me sign in"
- "find the download button"
- "search for something"
- "click the first result"
- "fill this form and submit"

All work without repetition or hardcoded paths!

🐛 REPETITION FIX:

The system now:
✅ Tracks all previous actions
✅ Detects when suggesting same action
✅ Auto-stops if stuck 3+ times
✅ Shows clear error instead of loop
✅ Lets you provide feedback to steer differently

If AI gets stuck:
- It will stop and show error
- Your "Done" button won't freeze
- You can click "Done" to retry
- Or provide feedback for different approach
